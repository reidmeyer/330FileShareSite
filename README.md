CREATIVE:
Added a way for users to rename their files. This was coded in the files.php page in which a user can type in the name of the file they want changed
then type in the name they want the file changed to.

CREATIVE 2: 
Added a way for users to view the details of their uploaded files such as being able to see the time and date of upload and allowing them
to view the size of the file that was uploaded. 

CREATIVE 3:
MADE IT SO YOU CAN CREATE A NEW USER
